# mr-provisioner-kea-dhcp4-role
Ansible role for installing/upgrading a kea-dhcp4 server, which is required for a fully functional Mr. Provisioner installation.

#Â Overview
This Ansible allows you to install kea-dhpc4, and the mr-provisioner-kea hook in an automated way.
You have two choices : either you install kea and the hook, and build them on the target machine,
Or you give a .deb package to this role to install instead.
We recommend you go for the former option, as kea takes 192/20 minutes to build (depending on how many cores and memory you throw at it). Sadly, no official deb package is distributed.
